      <h2>Rescue Sports & Adventure Tourism</h2>
      <p>Since 2015 I have been part of the Small Academy of Rescue Service, a regional branch of the nationwide youth movement
        “School of Safety.” In 2017 I became the team captain, leading training schedules, competition strategies, and mentorship for
        new members. I hold the First-Category (Adult) qualification in rescue sports, reflecting proficiency across rope
        work, technical rescue, and survival disciplines.</p>
      <p>In 2020 the Federation of Sport Tourism of Ukraine certified me as an official referee, allowing me to organize
        and judge national-level events. As an athlete I have competed—and frequently medaled—in city, regional, and
        nationwide rescue competitions. Our team earned fourth place at the XV International Youth Fire Rescue Rally in
        Gomel, Belarus (2017), while I have also collected individual podiums in rope rescue, obstacle courses, and
        orienteering challenges.</p>

      <h2>Sports Tourism Volunteering</h2>
      <p>As a volunteer for youth sports tourism programs, I guide students through orienteering challenges,
        teamwork drills, and survival basics. This experience reinforces leadership skills and the ability to stay calm
        in dynamic environments.</p>

      <h2>Cycling & Strength Training</h2>
      <p>Cycling helps me maintain cardio fitness while balancing the demands of engineering work. I combine it with
        bodyweight and resistance training to stay injury-free and ready for long outdoor sessions.</p>
